# LendBook

A lending limit order book is a non-custodial, peer to peer, permissionless, high LTV lending protocol which allows users to borrow assets
backing limit orders. This new primitive brings users multiple benefits:
stop loss orders with guaranteed stop price for borrowers, zero liquidation
costs, and high leverage for leveraged traders and interest-bearing limit
orders for makers. In addition, the protocol is immune to the risk of bad
debt and can be run with minimized governance.
